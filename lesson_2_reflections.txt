What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

The only thing of significance that happens is that it creates the .git folder which 
holds all the meta data that is used to track files changes. You can delete a
repository by simply deleting this file and preserving the rest of the files in the 
folder.  You can also recreate this file again which creates the repository by
simply issuing the: git init command.  

But remember that if you do decide to delete the the .git folder all your version
tracking of your files in that directory is gone.

I forgot that you are also put on the "branch master."
