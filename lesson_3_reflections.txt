When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

You would want to create a remote repository to collaborate or to back up files or both. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

When I was on Github and created and committed a file I need to edit the file because of a mistake.
I had to do this two times so I committed three times in total. I'd rather pull the changes
down after the last commit rather than have Git automatically pull it from the remote.
